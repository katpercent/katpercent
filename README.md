# 👋 Hi, I’m [Badis Khelladi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/badis-khelladi-360656349/)   

### 💫 About Me
I’m passionate about **cybersecurity, low-level programming,  
and exploring exciting fields such as game engines, compilers, and operating systems**.  
Currently, I’m focusing on the following projects:  
- 🎮 [BKGameEngine](https://github.com/katpercent/BKGameEngine) — 3D/2D rendering engine with SDL2 & OpenCL  
- 🔐 [BlacKipher](https://github.com/katpercent/BlacKipher) — cryptography and security-focused project  
- ⚙️ [BKompiler](https://github.com/katpercent/BKompiler) — custom compiler experiments  
- 🖥️ [BKhaOS](https://github.com/katpercent/BlacKhaOS) — operating system project

### ⚡ Automation Tools
I also develop **automation and workflow tools** to improve productivity and optimize complex data pipelines:
 - [DeepFetch](https://github.com/katpercent/DeepFetch) — full automation pipeline combining **multimedia capture, OCR, and Whisper-based transcription**  
  - includes *Network fetch*, a Playwright-powered module for **detecting and logging video stream requests (m3u8, mp4, ts)** directly from web sessions  

These tools reflect my passion for turning complex workflows into seamless automated systems, connecting software, AI, and data engineering in a practical way.
